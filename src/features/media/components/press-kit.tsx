          <div className="space-y-3 text-[14px] text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 md:text-[15px]">
            <p>
              Verus was conceived in 2018 by a team of visionary developers led
              by Michael J. Toutonghi. Born from the idea that blockchain
              technology could do more than just facilitate transactions, Verus
              envisions a more equitable and transparent society enabled by
              blockchain technology.
            </p>
            <p>
              The mission is to create a secure, privacy-centric platform that
              empowers people to express opinions anonymously yet verifiably,
              participate in a fair decentralized economy, and establish
              self-sovereign identities. Verus aims to leverage collective human
              intelligence and integrate machine learning while preserving
              privacy.
            </p>
            <p>
              Verus seeks to build tools that incentivize community behavior and
              enable direct querying of populations to surface honest public
              opinion. By rewarding positive contributions and respecting
              individual privacy, Verus aims to create a more transparent and
              equitable framework for society, fostering trust and cooperation
              in a decentralized digital ecosystem.

          <h3 className="mb-3 text-[18px] font-medium text-gray-900 dark:text-white">
            Development Journey
          </h3>
          <div className="space-y-3 text-[14px] text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 md:text-[15px]">
            <p>
              The development journey of Verus began months before the first
              block was mined. From the very beginning, the protocol was
              designed to address the limitations of existing blockchain
              technologies. Over time, Verus has achieved many significant
              milestones.
            </p>
            <p>
              The protocol's development has been marked by constant innovation,
              such as the full release of its Public Blockchains as a Service
              protocol in May 2023, and the release of the first non-custodial
              and consensus proven bridge to Ethereum in October 2023. And the
              protocol will continue to drive innovation in the blockchain
              world.

            <p>
              One of Verus' key standout features is its Proof of Power
              consensus mechanism, which balances the strengths of proof-of-work
              and proof-of-stake to maintain network security.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another is the full release of its Public Blockchain as a Service
              (PBaaS), which enabled the unlimited scale multi-chain and
              multi-currency part of the protocol, featuring UTXO-resistant
              DeFi.
            </p>
            <p>
              The protocol's fair launch, with no ICO, premine, dev fees, or
              taxes, underscores its commitment to equity and fairness, and is a
              prerequisite for being credibly neutral public infrastructure.

            <p>
              Verus is not a company or business, it is best compared to
              Bitcoin. The protocol thrives on active community involvement, and
              it is the worldwide community that steers the direction of the
              protocol.
            </p>
            <p>
              The community plays a pivotal role in the protocol's development,
              contributing to various initiatives and ensuring the network's
              decentralized nature. The governance of the protocol comprises the
              nodes, miners, and stakers.

              Now that the foundation is finished (in Oct 2023) it is time to
              actively attract entrepreneurs, developers and builders. As more
              people understand what value Verus can bring them, the bigger the
              ecosystem will grow.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Verus Protocol is here now, and everyone can utilize it,
              without permission, to start building Web3 and any type of dApps.
              Some examples are voting and polling systems, payment systems,
              social media platforms, customer loyalty programs, (private)
              communication networks, and so much more that is possible.
