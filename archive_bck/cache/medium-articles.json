      "content": "<h4>Imagine a DeFi world without front-running, back-running, or sandwich attacks. A world where every user gets a fair price, and transaction fees don‚Äôt suddenly skyrocket. This isn‚Äôt a distant dream‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääit‚Äôs the reality with Verus. MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) is rampant on VM-based blockchains like Ethereum, causing users to lose money and suffer unfair trading practices. But Verus has changed the game with its innovative protocol design, making MEV attacks a thing of the past. Let‚Äôs explore how Verus is redefining DeFi with its MEV-resistance at the protocol¬†layer.</h4><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*7iloLqQbSInUQU9i02yjqg.png\" /></figure><h3>MEV and its Consequences</h3><p>Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) is the maximum value that can be extracted from block production in cryptocurrency networks, beyond the standard block¬†rewards.</p><p>A block producer, whether a miner or staker, can make a profit by their ability to arbitrarily include, exclude or re-order transactions within the blocks they produce. There are also bots that continuously search the pool of pending transactions (the mempool) for profitable opportunities. This behavior by block producers and bots leads to users being front-run, back-run or sandwich attacked on their transactions.</p><p>Front-running involves placing a transaction before a target transaction, while back-running places one immediately after. Sandwich attacks combine both, surrounding a target transaction. This behavior takes advantage of the time between when a transaction is announced (it‚Äôs in the mempool) and when it‚Äôs processed, allowing manipulators to benefit from price movements caused by the target transaction.</p><p>This malicious behavior leads to worse-than-expected execution prices and high transaction fees for regular users doing swaps or trades on AMMs (automated market makers) or DEXs (decentralized exchanges). A sudden high transaction fee can also lead to failing transactions, costing users gas fees without completing the intended trade. At worst, it can even lead to protocol instability.</p><p>Another thing to keep in mind is the possible problematic merger of traditional finance and decentralized finance. Front-running, and back-running are illegal practices in traditional finance but common in DeFi. Regulators are likely to view these tactics as unacceptable market manipulation, especially when applied to RWAs (real-world assets). VM-based blockchains have to balance the open, permissionless nature of the blockchain with the expectations of fairness and protection that come with mainstream financial adoption. The giant elephant in the room asks‚Ä¶ Can blockchain protocols where MEV is endemic be used for mainstream adoption?</p><h3>MEV Resistance in¬†Verus</h3><p>How Verus is MEV-resistant is actually really simple and doesn‚Äôt need complicated ways that try to mitigate it. It is inherently not in the protocol by forward-looking protocol¬†design.</p><p>You can find Verus DeFi within the consensus layer of the protocol. All currencies (e.g. tokens, liquidity pools) are accounted for by the miners and stakers. This is very different from Ethereum, for example, where only ETH is accounted for by the stakers, and where ERC-20s are not. On VM-based blockchains DeFi is programmed at the smart contract layer, which has many vulnerability surfaces, and what is happening in those smart contracts is not verified by the block producers.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*5Vdh4s60CEDhKlK6R0BneQ.png\" /></figure><h4>No Transaction Ordering</h4><p>All VM-based blockchains solve transactions sequentially. This is their fundamental design flaw. Because of this, transactions can be ordered, by either block producers or bots paying higher gas fees to ‚Äúskip the line.‚Äù This is what makes MEV possible.</p><p>Unlike VM-based blockchains that solve transactions sequentially, Verus, a UTXO-based blockchain, solves transactions simultaneously. Front-running, back-running and sandwich attacks are impossible since there is no ‚Äúfront‚Äù or ‚Äúback‚Äù. Transactions (and thus conversions) are not¬†ordered.</p><p>Conversions are solved simultaneously within 1 to 10 blocks, depending on how many conversions are made. The conversions are triggered when there are 10 transactions made, or 10 blocks have passed if it‚Äôs not busy. If it‚Äôs busy all the time, then conversions are solved every 2 blocks. This leads to a MEV-resistant protocol, but also to fair pricing and enhanced liquidity through offsetting.</p><figure><img alt=\"Graphic showing transactions in a block are solved simultaneously for Verus, and serially for VM-based blockchains.\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*AfZ71ZRIjsZRKTwx8bGaqQ.png\" /></figure><h4>Fair Pricing and Enhanced Liquidity</h4><p>Because all transactions (conversions) are solved simultaneously (1 to 10 blocks), all conversions on the same ‚Äútrading pair‚Äù get the same fair price. Keep in mind that there can be many ‚Äútrading pairs‚Äù that are the same, but when they are in different basket currencies, they are treated as separate.</p><p>Important to note is that orders are offset against each other. For example, if one user wants to sell 100 currency X (for Y) and another wants to buy 80 currency X with Y, 80 of that currency is directly matched, leaving only 20 to affect the overall market price. This also means there is reduced price impact, and thus less slippage.</p><p>Another benefit is enhanced liquidity. Instead of each conversion drawing from or adding to the liquidity pool sequentially, the net effect is applied, making more efficient use of the available liquidity. The actual liquidity in the pool might not change, but the offsetting effect makes it behave as if there was more liquidity available because offsetting orders are matched directly, reducing the need to draw from or add to the¬†pool.</p><p>Then you also have the market arbitrageurs, who now not only make a profit for themselves, they also stabilize the market overall, giving all participants a fair price. With a very low fee of 0.025% or 0.05% of the conversion (without gas fees), it is a great system for all kinds of market participants.</p><blockquote>Verus DeFi protocol wide volume in July 2024 was close to $14M.

Also you learn how to bridge tBTC to the Verus¬†network.</h4><h3>What is¬†Pure?</h3><p>Pure is a decentralized currency launched on the Verus blockchain. It is fully backed by its reserves: Verus (VRSC) and Bitcoin (tBTC), with a reserve ratio of¬†50/50%.</p><p>The currency is called Pure because it aligns with the true ideals of decentralization and transparency:</p><ul><li>Bitcoin and Verus are fully decentralized and controlled by its nodes and block producers. No single entity or company controls them. They are not a business‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthey are rent-free protocols.</li><li>Bitcoin and Verus had fair launches. No ICO, no premine and no developer fees or¬†taxes.</li><li>Bitcoin and Verus have a limited¬†supply.</li><li>Bitcoin and Verus are censorship-resistant.</li></ul><p>Hold Pure to be exposed to two decentralized cryptocurrencies upholding true cypherpunk values.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*LlQgdar9DMQYgh2cVZMAKg.png\" /></figure><h4>Pure is an¬†AMM</h4><p>Another benefit of holding Pure is that the currency accrues conversion fees. When users convert from Pure to VRSC or tBTC (or vice versa) they pay a conversion fee of 0.025%. When users convert between VRSC and tBTC they pay a conversion fee of¬†0.05%.</p><p>Half of those conversion fees (50%) stay in the Pure reserves, increasing the value of Pure since no new Pure is minted. The conversions are MEV-resistant and verified by the miners and stakers of the protocol. <a href=\"https://docs.verus.io/sendcurrency/\">Learn more about Verus¬†DeFi</a>.</p><p>Conversions between VRSC and tBTC are only possible after the preconversion period has ended on Sunday 24 March,¬†2024.</p><p>Users can also create subIDs which cost 0.00021 tBTC.vETH (in Pure). These costs are burned reducing Pure in circulation. <a href=\"https://docs.verus.io/verusid/\">Learn more about VerusID and what you can do with it here</a>. If users create an identity with your subID as referral, they pay 2/3 less‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääyou get 1/3 and 1/3 is discounted.</p><h3>Preconversion period before the launch of¬†Pure</h3><p>Before Pure was fully launched, there was an 8-day preconversion period. In that period users could fund the reserves of Pure with VRSC and tBTC. During this period no conversions could be done. Depending on how much they added they got their fair share of 20,000 Pure after the 8 day¬†period.</p><p>The initial supply of Pure was 20,000. After the initial supply has been distributed by the protocol, the supply became dynamic. When users convert from VRSC or tBTC into Pure, Pure is minted. When people convert from Pure back to VRSC or tBTC, the Pure is¬†burned.</p><p>Learn below how Pure was launched without any coding needed.

The decentralized bridge between Bitcoin and Ethereum is supplied by the <a href=\"http://www.threshold.network/\">Threshold Network</a>.</p><blockquote>Existing solutions that bridge Bitcoin to Ethereum require users to send their Bitcoin to an intermediary, in exchange for an ERC-20 token that represents the original asset. This centralized model requires you to trust a third party and is susceptible to censorship, threatening the premise of Bitcoin as sovereign, secure, permissionless digital¬†asset.</blockquote><blockquote>The second generation of tBTC<strong> </strong>is a truly decentralized (and scalable) bridge between Bitcoin and Ethereum. It provides Bitcoin holders secure and open access to the broader DeFi ecosystem. tBTC v2 allows you to unlock your Bitcoin‚Äôs value to borrow and lend, mint stablecoins, provide liquidity, and much¬†more.</blockquote><p><strong>Get tBTC on Kraken, Uniswap, Curve &amp; others. </strong><a href=\"https://dashboard.threshold.network/tBTC/mint\"><strong>Or mint it¬†yourself</strong></a></p><p>tBTC token address: <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/token/0x18084fba666a33d37592fa2633fd49a74dd93a88\">https://etherscan.io/token/0x18084fba666a33d37592fa2633fd49a74dd93a88</a></p><p>You can send tBTC to your MetaMask wallet or Verus Mobile first, and later you have to bridge it to the Verus blockchain.

If a blockchain is less decentralized (low number of validators, permissioned access) it could be 51% attacked (by external attackers or colluding validators), and transactions can be altered or reversed, completely undermining one of the goals of blockchain‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääcensorship-resistance.</p><blockquote>The trilemma is currently looked at from a single-chain standpoint. A false premise that does not scale to the¬†world.</blockquote><p>There is truth to the fact that it is very difficult to have a decentralized single blockchain that also has a high tps. The larger the number of validators the harder it is to find consensus among them all, which makes them slower, and makes it more difficult to get them to process large numbers of transactions. To get a high tps blockchain you would need to lower the number of validators so they can find consensus more easily, and raise the hardware requirements for running a node so they can process those transactions quicker too. Yet doing so compromises true decentralization. The lower the number of validators, the less decentralized, the less robust. And the higher the hardware requirements, the less accessible it is for people around the world, the less decentralized.</p><p>The trilemma is currently looked at from a single-chain standpoint. A false premise that does not scale to the world. We will show you how Verus offers a new and better approach.</p><h3>Scalability Does NOT Mean High¬†Tps</h3><blockquote>Transactions per second are nothing more than just a performance indicator‚Ää‚Äî‚Äälike GHz for computers.</blockquote><p>Cryptocurrency protocols often boast about how fast their blockchains are (transactions per second) as an indicator of their scalability. Contrary to popular belief this is a false premise. Transactions per second are nothing more than just a performance indicator. Like how we use GHz (CPU clock speed) to indicate how fast a computer is, or an even better example‚Ää‚Äî‚Äähow fast servers¬†are.</p><p>To bring the promise of crypto to billions of people around the globe let‚Äôs make a comparison with the Internet. The Internet does not run on one single server. All websites and applications that we use daily are <strong>not</strong> connected to one single server. The Internet has not been scaled to the world by constantly upgrading the one server to a faster one. It‚Äôs millions of servers that are servicing billions of people around the world. These millions of servers are perfectly connected, and completely interoperable so that using the Internet today is a seamless experience.</p><p>Now, with this perspective in mind, let‚Äôs get back to the current situation in crypto land. Most, if not all, crypto protocols are trying to service the world with their one single, monolithic blockchain. The monolithic blockchain becomes a central hub where all smart contracts and applications revolve around. When they notice that it doesn‚Äôt scale (the transaction fees start ramping up) the industry comes up with solutions that heavily compromise on decentralization and security (e.g. L2s, semi-centralized protocols, master nodes). This is not the¬†answer.</p><p>Instead of acknowledging that the Internet today is a giant, interconnected multi-server world where all applications and websites are seamlessly connected, most of the crypto industry thinks we live in a single server (single blockchain) world.</p><p>Verus acknowledged that to realize the promise of cryptocurrency and blockchain, it needed to scale for billions of people around the globe and thus it needed to embrace a multi-server, multi-chain world. And that is exactly what the Verus Protocol does today. Without sacrificing decentralization and security.</p><h3>Unlimited in¬†Scale</h3><p>Before we start explaining how Verus is truly decentralized and secure, let‚Äôs start with how Verus embraces the multi-chain world and delivers unlimited scalability.</p><p>Most, if not all, current blockchain protocols argue that to have low transaction fees they must achieve higher transactions per second. They try to scale up‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääincreasing the performance of their monolithic blockchains. This only gets them so far. At some point, they will bottleneck again, and in the process, they compromise on decentralization and security.</p><p>Verus offers a new approach, one in which each organization or business can launch its own highly capable, rent-free, no-coding-required blockchain. It‚Äôs called Verus PBaaS (Public Blockchains as a Service). These PBaaS-chains are fully independent, can be customized to the organization‚Äôs need, inherit all the same features as the Verus blockchain, and most importantly are fully interconnected and interoperable with the complete network and other bridged protocols (e.g. Ethereum). A single PBaaS-chain can do between 75 and 800 tps depending on the options¬†chosen.</p><p>There is no upper limit to deploying PBaaS-chains. Just like there is no upper limit to servers being deployed. When we reach a bandwidth limit we don‚Äôt go out upgrading our single server, we put another server next to it to spread out the usage. The same thing is here, reaching unlimited scalability.</p><p>Of course, this only works when those PBaaS-chains are fully interoperable and interconnected, which they are‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääin a provable, trustless and decentralized way. There is no centralized entity sitting in between the PBaaS-chains regulating everything.</p><p>Cross-chain transactions and conversions, cross-chain bridging of identities (VerusID), tokens and basket currencies, even Ethereum (&amp; ERC20/ERC721/ERC1155)‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääit‚Äôs all built into the consensus mechanism, trustlessly bridged over by the decentralized network of miners and stakers only. This is all on mainnet now, for everyone to¬†use.</p><p>We can conclude that Verus is scalable to billions of people around the world with the unlimited deployment of PBaaS-chains. But does it compromise on decentralization and thus security? Let‚Äôs dive into¬†it.</p><iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FoG60YnFP_JU%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;display_name=YouTube&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DoG60YnFP_JU&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FoG60YnFP_JU%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/d89549a75e18409e1ad7c6927f253718/href\">https://medium.com/media/d89549a75e18409e1ad7c6927f253718/href</a></iframe><h3>Built to be Decentralized</h3><p>There are a few things at play here that work in harmony to achieve decentralization and security‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäVerus Proof of Power (the hybrid 50% proof-of-work, 50% proof-of-stake consensus mechanism), merge-mining and the Fee¬†Pool.</p><blockquote>Verus had no ICO, had no premine and had and has no developer fee or¬†tax.</blockquote><p>Before we jump into the above let‚Äôs acknowledge some facts that are pivotal to being a true decentralized protocol, to being credibly neutral. Just like Bitcoin before, Verus had no ICO, had no premine and had and has no developer fee or tax. Verus is not a company or a business. Verus is rent-free and all protocol fees go to the block producers. These facts are super important to incentivize decentralization and to be a credibly neutral protocol in the eyes of the¬†world.</p><h4>A Hybrid Consensus Mechanism</h4><p>Now let‚Äôs unpack Verus Proof of Power, the consensus mechanism of the Verus blockchain, and all PBaaS-chains. It‚Äôs a hybrid of 50% proof-of-work and 50% proof-of-stake, and it‚Äôs <a href=\"https://verus.io/papers/VerusPoP.pdf\">a provable solution to 51% hash attacks</a>. Out of the 1440 daily blocks (on Verus, and when a PBaaS-chain opts for 1-minute block times), half is solved by mining and half by¬†staking.</p><p>VerusHash, the proof-of-work mechanism which disincentivizes ASIC &amp; FPGA development, and favors CPUs, mobile phones and ARM-devices for mining. Mining with mobile phones and for example, Orange Pi 5‚Äôs are the most cost-efficient way to do it. This proves a significant leap towards a more inclusive mining environment. It‚Äôs accessible to everyone and thus creates a naturally decentralized protocol.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*TlMla8UIwilTYouUezI3pA.jpeg\" /><figcaption>An Orange Pi 5 mining farm by community member¬†DCAL4.</figcaption></figure><p>Additionally, to give even more power to miners, they can merge-mine up to 22 PBaaS-chains simultaneously without sacrificing their original hashing power. This dramatically increases efficiency and network security. So, when considering an unlimited number of PBaaS-chains on the network, each miner can choose up to 22 to mine. They can choose for profitability, or choose the ones they want to¬†support.</p><p>This approach to mining is environmentally conscious. The protocol‚Äôs design allows for low-power devices to mine extremely efficiently. It lowers the entry barrier for participation in blockchain validation, especially in low-income countries, yet can also give life to phones that are old or with broken screens. Thus significantly reducing the environmental impact associated with traditional PoW¬†mining.</p><p>Then we have the proof-of-stake part of the consensus mechanism. This one is really simple and powerful. Anyone can run a node and start staking. There is no minimum amount of VRSC needed (pretty unique in the world of PoS). Verus <a href=\"https://medium.com/veruscoin/how-verus-solved-nothing-at-stake-and-weak-subjectivity-proof-of-stake-problems-b4dd6a85086e\">solved the ‚Äúnothing-at-stake‚Äù-problem</a> therefore there is no slashing of funds. Funds staking are never locked and running a node can be done with something as cheap as a Raspberry Pi 4. All-in-all proving yet again that Verus is accessible to everyone, creating a naturally decentralized protocol.</p><p>We can conclude that Verus is truly a decentralized protocol, naturally emerging from its extremely low-barrier mining and staking. So what does that mean for security?</p><h3>Protocol Security at Another¬†Level</h3><p>Seeing as the Verus Protocol is naturally decentralized and provable 51% hash attack resistant, it‚Äôs extremely secure. PBaaS-chains take these properties with them as they have the same consensus mechanism, and the Verus miners can choose up to 21 of them to merge-mine. It‚Äôs fair to say that there is no compromise on security given the scalability of the protocol.</p><h4>Verus Introduces the Fee¬†Pool</h4><p>Let‚Äôs first explain the fees the protocol generates for the miners and¬†stakers:</p><ul><li>PBaaS-chain launches: 10,000 VRSC (5,000 for the block producers of Verus, 5,000 for the block producers of the newly launched¬†chain)</li><li>Currency launches (tokens, basket currencies, liquidity pools, ERC-20 mapped currencies): 200¬†VRSC</li><li>VerusID registrations: 100, 80, 60, 40 or 20¬†VRSC</li><li>subID registrations: 0.02¬†VRSC</li><li>DeFi conversion fees: min. 0.0125%, max.¬†0.025%</li><li>Transaction fees: 0.0001¬†VRSC</li></ul><p>Builders and users pay these protocol fees for their operations and the fees are directed into the Fee Pool. Then, for each new block, 1% of the Fee Pool is added on top of the regular coinbase reward (currently 6¬†VRSC).</p><p>The Fee Pool is introduced as a security measure to keep the protocol stable. We have seen in other blockchain protocols that when a block has large fees, block producers try to ‚Äúsnipe‚Äù the block (putting lots of hash onto the network, then pulling it out of the network, or even trying to reorder the blocks for their own gain). In doing so they destabilize the protocol. Verus mitigates this behavior by spreading the extra fees over many¬†blocks.</p><h4>Smart Contracts Are Not¬†Secure</h4><p>Most blockchain protocols use the VM-based application model‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääsmart contracts written with Solidity. It‚Äôs full of smart contract hacks and bugs and has insecure and phishing-prone wallet approval mechanisms. On top of that MEV (maximum extractable value) is rampant, due to the serial processing of transactions on the VM-model (it‚Äôs easy for a block producer to reorder transactions inside a block for their own gain). We can honestly say that the VM-model is not¬†secure.</p><p>The Verus approach is different as it follows the fundamental systems design principle‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe most important security layers should be located in the protocol itself, and not coded on top via L2 (smart contracts). All operations on Verus and PBaaS-chains are directly connected to consensus, secured by the miners and stakers of the protocol.</p><p>Now you might ask yourself ‚ÄúBut can we build dApps that are as capable as building them with the VM-model?‚Äù. The answer is yes. Developing dApps with Verus is much more straightforward than building to a VM-based application model and results in inherently more capable, secure and scalable solutions.</p><h3>Does Verus Solve the Blockchain Trilemma?</h3><p>A fair question. And hopefully we answered with enough detail. The answer is¬†‚Äúyes!‚Äù.</p><p>Let‚Äôs summarize. Verus does not compromise on decentralization and security to reach unlimited scalability. Unlimited scalability is reached by scaling out, not scaling up. It is the equivalent not of upgrading your server but of putting an extra server next to it to spread the bandwidth around.</p><p>Decentralization is achieved by making mining and staking accessible for everyone through extremely low hardware requirements. This naturally creates a large number of miners and nodes (stakers), making the network robust against attacks of all¬†sorts.</p><p>High security is not only reached through the decentralized nature of the network but also because of the Fee Pool and the fact that all operations are directly connected to consensus and thus the miners and¬†stakers.</p><h4>Now is the Time to Build with¬†Verus</h4><p>Without having to rely on smart contracts, builders can develop dApps that are even more powerful, secure and scalable. Builders can use the no-coding-required API commands, together with VerusID and its VDXF (Verus Data Exchange Format) as a controlled public storage system with multiple levels of nesting to create dApps of any¬†kind.</p><p>The foundation has been laid for a true Internet of Value.

The Verus Protocol solves issues with gas fees, enables unlimited scale, is not vulnerable to smart contract hacks and bugs, addresses MEV at the protocol level, provides an identity model (<a href=\"https://docs.verus.io/verusid/\">VerusID</a>) that applications can leverage and profit from, includes provable cross-chain and multichain support, does away with insecure and phishing-prone wallet approval mechanisms, and does not require expensive Solidity developers for applications, unless they must also have an Ethereum component to¬†them.</p><p>All these issues are solved with the L0/1 Verus Protocol. Verus does not use smart contracts‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääit uses smart transactions. Verus smart transactions [<a href=\"https://medium.com/veruscoin/verus-smart-transactions-vs-smart-contracts-f98079c00ed0\"><strong>read more</strong></a>] are much easier to use (no programming needed) in practice to achieve most capabilities, if not all, compared to VM-protocols that use smart contracts. Yet Verus is still fully interoperable with Ethereum through the non-custodial, trustless and decentralized Verus-Ethereum Bridge with liquidity pool currency [<a href=\"https://docs.verus.io/eth-bridge/\"><strong>more on the¬†Bridge</strong></a>].</p><h3>Showcasing Verus App-Development Opportunities at Consensus 2024</h3><p>Get ready for a new era of decentralized application development. Unlike today‚Äôs complex smart contract applications, requiring VM-based smart contracts that talk to user facing applications through server-side APIs and phishing-prone web-interfaces using public key hashes or rented names as identity, the Verus network is a Layer 1 (L1) and Layer 0 (L0) protocol with composable and powerful multi-chain core primitives, including identities, currencies, MEV-resistant liquidity baskets, updateable, even transferable ID-bound databases that can comprise NFTs and real world assets, all on a 100% fully decentralized, unlimited scale backbone, secured by the 50% proof-of-stake / 50% proof-of-work, 51% hash attack resistant Verus Proof of Power (PoP) consensus and accessible securely from mobile clients or cloud-based web-applications.</p><p>Build applications in your favorite framework for clients and access the Verus network either through QR-codes and deep-links to a client-side wallet under user control or talk directly to data-indexed, blockchain nodes, capable of providing fast access to an unlimited number of user identities and their unlimited Verus Data Exchange Format (VDXF) indexable key-value database providing provable, optionally private, worldwide resolvable data at unlimited scale over an unlimited number of blockchains. All of this power, including inherent eCommerce and markets of all types are usable by applications, and unlike yesterday‚Äôs Internet, application-owned data stays under application control, while user-owned data remains under user control and subject to voluntary, provable disclosure, protected by zero knowledge privacy, as it should always have¬†been.</p><p>Write applications your way, your client frameworks, your languages, with links and RPC calls to the decentralized Internet of Value. Connect through one or more blockchains. Use, create, sell, and provision your application‚Äôs permanent IDs for secure login, KYC, commerce, and provable data at scale, all on the rent-free, credibly neutral and fully decentralized Internet of¬†Value.</p><p>Builders of applications, organizations, and businesses can use the Verus Protocol to provision IDs, manage and interact with users and user state at any scale, launch currencies (e.g. tokens, liquidity baskets [<a href=\"https://docs.verus.io/currencies/launch-currency.html\"><strong>see docs</strong></a>]), even fully interoperable, independent, customizable worldwide blockchains with their own economics and fee structure, while sharing mining and economic power across the entire Verus Protocol network of unlimited PBaaS chains. All currencies, whether native currencies of a new blockchain, easily created and minted tokens, or MEV-resistant liquidity baskets are easy to launch and access with the protocol on Verus or any connected PBaaS chain. All of them, from the moment they are launched can be exported to Ethereum as ERC20s [<a href=\"https://docs.verus.io/currencies/export-to-eth.html\"><strong>see docs</strong></a>] or ERC721 currencies or any chain across the Verus ecosystem. All currencies on the network, including tokens, cross-chain currencies, and even liquidity baskets and their supplies are secured by miners and stakers according to protocol rules. On other blockchain networks, this level of security is applied to single native currencies, on Verus, all currencies on a chain are primitives known to and accounted for by the protocol, eliminating entire classes of smart contract risks that result when every contract reinvents a new way to account for its currency but has no systemic¬†control.</p><p>With Verus, currencies are compatible with ERC20s. Verus applications can leverage, but do not require Solidity developers or VM-based programming. Additionally all ERC-20s can be permissionlessly bridged over from Ethereum to Verus [<a href=\"https://docs.verus.io/currencies/mapping-1:1-eth.html\"><strong>see docs</strong></a>], giving users and application builders the freedom to switch seamlessly between the Verus and Ethereum networks.</p><p>All currencies on the Verus network (also the ones bridged over from Ethereum) can be used with Verus DeFi, another primitive inherent to the protocol. Verus DeFi enables liquidity baskets of up to 10 underlying reserve currencies and can serve as a unique, self-balancing, MEV-resistant portfolio, a permissionless or permissioned ID registrar where fees go to the LPs of the basket, or an easy way to send from any reserve currency or the basket currency itself to any other without worrying about block builder reordering or MEV, as all conversions of a liquidity basket in any direction that are processed within one or more blocks are always solved simultaneously, no front and not back. Every conversion gets the same price in each direction with no spread and an ultra low fee (max. 0.05%), again, all part of the L1 consensus.</p><p>Whether you plan to build eCommerce enabled supply chains, massively scalable ownership-based games, real world asset eCommerce enabled networks, voting systems, identity management networks, communication networks, financial networks, 3D metaverses with identities, brands, and ownership or just about any application for a better Web3 on the Internet of Value, you‚Äôll be left behind if you don‚Äôt deep dive on Verus¬†first.</p><p>Join us in the next crypto revolution.

We hope that the hackers were unable to fool anyone into giving up the funds from their Metamask or other Web wallets and that the criminals‚Äô efforts resulted in a negative¬†return.</p><p>This should be a cautionary tale for any communities using Discord, and we will detail what we experienced, in hopes that it might prevent another Discord community from experiencing the same or similar issues. The hackers used a Discord session hijack vulnerability that is currently in use across some notorious hacking groups along with social engineering to inflict significant damage on the Discord server where the Verus community spends much of its time when coordinating. These attacks had no effect on the Verus network, and although the hackers did get control of the Discord server, they did not need to get full control or credentials for any account to inflict their damage on the Discord server. We believe the attack could easily have been cut short immediately if Discord could improve their false positive account disablement as well as their response time to critical support requests.</p><p>What we have determined so¬†far:</p><p>1. The group targeted me and worked to establish trust as journalists for weeks, always persistent, never pushy. After working with me on an article, where I contributed the following content (<a href=\"https://medium.com/@michaeltoutonghi/what-inspired-the-creation-of-verus-coin-and-how-long-has-it-been-in-development-12731aaa9be4\">Verus Article from¬†Hack</a>).</p><p>2.

Once they rewrote it, I clicked a link from their Discord server, and although they weren‚Äôt able to get login credentials, they exploited a session hijack link, and immediately went to¬†work.</p><p>4. After they had my account, which had setup the Discord server so many years ago, under their control, they kicked off all admins, installed their own admins, and did something that Discord would have to help explain that got Discord to instantly ban my account, the only one besides Discord that could have kicked them¬†off.</p><p>5. Since then, they started announcing scam links, claiming fraudulent giveaways with Ethereum tokens backed by Verus on websites that if someone with a Metamask or similar wallet engages with, there is a risk of taking assets from them on Ethereum or possibly other networks, not¬†Verus.</p><p>6. We still have not heard from or gotten help from Discord Support since this event began, except that they banned my account, and to our knowledge the scammers are still in the old Verus Discord server attempting to scam an ever dwindling group of members who haven‚Äôt left by¬†now.</p><p>7. If you know anyone in the old Discord, please inform them to leave the Discord asap and not engage in any of the announcements, as they are made by impersonators, while people trying to warn are banned and the original admins are locked out of the¬†server.</p><p>8. My old Discord ID is now disabled by Discord, and I no longer have access to our conversations. My new account is miketout.vrsc (this ID), which is not the owner of this Discord, and we have implemented a set of processes for all Discord admins to prevent any such event from occurring again.</p><p>Since the Verus Community is much more than a Discord Server, though we still haven‚Äôt found a more suitable engagement platform for the way the community works, a number of people have worked to create and secure a new community Discord Server, and we welcome all Verus Community members and well meaning interested people to¬†join.</p><p>Though we are still hoping to have a conversation with Discord about the hack and how they could improve their security to prevent this for all of their user communities in the future, we have taken steps independently to harden the Verus Discord community in a way that would prevent such an attack in the future, even if the link click session hijack exploit is not resolved. We also have even better security thoughts for the future around leveraging VerusID in easy, meaningful ways. If you have experience writing Discord bots and especially secure servers, please get in touch. Until then, we hope you will rejoin or join the Verus Community‚Äôs Discord server and the worldwide, unlimited scale, fully decentralized blockchain protocol conversation.</p><p>Get an invite for the new Verus Discord Community Server: <a href=\"https://verus.io/discord\">https://verus.io/discord</a></p><p>COPY UNTIL THE END OF THE LINE ABOVE THIS¬†ONE</p><p>This article is signed by my ID, mike@ on the Verus network with the following signature:</p><p>AX8OKwABQSBhYU0ShQsu6LSRVay8IY7avMhoy3ub8jhznZnlhD5nGRE4h4U5MEWiPg+DXGJRSXd3bWou5TfNHn/zEPfbMA7d</p><p>(if you are using Safari or possibly another browser, you may need this signature, as the copy comes out a bit different):</p><p>AZAOKwABQSCaekvVN3CBbneot9AHby8S0+YCYevJDSfps3iaML8BF0j9PMdO/37JYxHbuDy/R11hWe9tCI5AInjppcQhQ3hD</p><p>You can verify my signature on any Verus node or lite mode API, by copying the article between the instructions above and entering the ID as mike@ and the signature above to check.

Around 5000 VRSC is used to subsidize the fees on the Verus side. When the bridge currency gets launched, the VRSC that is left will be put into the reserves.</p><h4>Dynamic Supply</h4><p>The Bridge.vETH supply is dynamic (after the preconversion has finished and the bridge currency is launched). The currency gets minted when people convert to it from VRSC, vETH, DAI.vETH and MKR.vETH, or gets burned when people convert out of¬†it.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*XoN8sa1dlD1JVblcT_T3Lw.png\" /><figcaption>After the bridge currency is launched you can convert into any direction.</figcaption></figure><blockquote><strong><em>Worth noting</em></strong><em>: Verus DeFi is MEV-resistant.

Verus does things, yet again, very different.</p><h3>Why the Verus-Ethereum Bridge is Different</h3><p>The Verus-Ethereum Bridge is different because the assets are never in anyone‚Äôs custody. This is done through the seamless cooperation between the block producers, community notary witnesses, the Bridgekeeper software and the Ethereum smart contract. At each step during cross-chain transactions the assets are verified and proven by consensus rules, with safeguards in place to prevent¬†hacks.</p><p>Every 10 blocks validators create a notarization. They create these digital receipts for both Verus and Ethereum. The digital receipts, called ‚Äúnotarizations‚Äô‚Äô, contain, among other things: the ‚Äústateroot‚Äù (<a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/merkle-root-cryptocurrency.asp\">Merkle Mountain Range</a> for Verus, <a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/data-structures-and-encoding/patricia-merkle-trie/\">Merkle Patricia Trie</a> for Ethereum), the blockheight, blockhash and the gas price for Ethereum. The notarizations have to be agreed to by the block producers (miners and stakers) and are then mined into the Verus blockchain.</p><blockquote>üëâ <a href=\"https://medium.com/veruscoin/verus-internet-protocol-vip-provable-decentralized-cross-chain-communication-8d9414a429c5\"><strong>Read more here</strong></a><strong> </strong>on how the Verus Protocol handles cross-chain communication (PBaaS-chains and more) in a decentralized and provable¬†way.</blockquote><h4>Safeguards Against Bridge¬†Hacks</h4><p>Threats caused by malicious notary witnesses, or stolen keys to drain funds are not viable against the Verus-Ethereum bridge. To successfully mount an attack on the bridge, if a majority of witnesses were colluding or got their private keys stolen the following would need to¬†happen:</p><ol><li>Colluding, malicious witnesses.</li><li>Fake block producers with more combined hash and stake power than the publicly validated Verus blockchain.</li><li>Developers helping them by creating an alternate protocol for the shadow¬†chain.</li></ol><p>These requirements are very close to the requirements of attacking any blockchain. The bridge even provides a way to defend against such an unlikely scenario.</p><p>The notary witnesses are also monitoring notarizations, and if they were to sign for something that they themselves do not agree with, they can auto-revoke their identities, using the VerusID protocol, which cannot be stopped by an attacker unless they have stolen both the keys for the notary ID and those for its revocation ID as well. This serves as a prevention for stolen key attacks, ensuring that notaries are extremely hard targets to compromise.</p><h4>Bridgekeeper</h4><p>The two blockchains, Verus and Ethereum, are fundamentally different from each other, but still need to be able to communicate. A translator is needed. This translator is a program called Bridgekeeper. Notary witnesses have to run the program. Miners and stakers are also encouraged to run it, and for doing so they receive¬†fees.</p><p><a href=\"https://github.com/VerusCoin/Verusbridgekeeper\">Bridgekeeper for CLI</a> / <a href=\"https://youtu.be/kyEqBX_erJo?si=UOajk4TnSD0ToRY4\">How to become a Bridgekeeper‚Ää‚Äî‚Äävideo</a></p><h4>Verus ‚û°Ô∏è¬†Ethereum</h4><p>Let‚Äôs consider a scenario where a user wants to move or convert assets from Verus to Ethereum. This transaction gets recorded on the Verus blockchain. When there are enough, or a certain time period has passed, these cross-chain transactions are rolled up into something called a ‚ÄòCCE‚Äô (cross-chain export). This CCE is then added to a block by a miner or staker and they are rewarded a fee for doing so. The CCE is now officially part of the blockchain, and is linked to the ‚Äústateroot‚Äù (<a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/merkle-root-cryptocurrency.asp\">Merkle Mountain Range</a>, which is an unchangeable overall summary of the blockchain at that block, and anything preceding it).</p><p>Meanwhile, as the transactions (CCE) are being mined (or staked) in, the notarizations are also being mined or staked in, confirmed by miners and stakers, and only then, signed by the notary witnesses. The notarizations can occur as often as every 10 blocks, depending on how many miners and stakers are running Bridgekeeper. Before a notarization is used as proof, it has to be on the blockchain for 10 blocks, confirmed by another notarization, and also signed by at least 8 of 15 notary witnesses worldwide.</p><p>Then when the notarization is confirmed on Verus, it‚Äôs sent over to Ethereum and becomes pending on Ethereum. Once confirmed on Ethereum by receiving another notarization, the transactions (CCE) in that block are sent over to the Ethereum smart contract, along with the <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/merkle-root-cryptocurrency.asp\">Merkle Mountain Range</a> proof. If valid the assets are sent to the users Ethereum¬†wallet.</p><p>Anyone can roll up the transactions into a CCE and mine it in to get a reward, but also the notary witnesses paying the ETH fees to send it to Ethereum get a share of the fees to subsidize their transaction costs.</p><p>If there is no traffic from Verus to Ethereum, the notarizations are continued to be mined in on Verus but do not need to be sent to Ethereum, so when the traffic is light, there is minimal¬†cost.</p><h4>Ethereum ‚û°Ô∏è¬†Verus</h4><p>The above part explains going from Verus to Ethereum, but the other way around is actually a little bit different. It is not the notary witnesses that send the group of transactions over, but any miner and staker can, and thus also get part of the¬†fees.</p><p>Notarizations made on Verus always contain a stateroot from Ethereum that is a minimum of 30 blocks old (blocks on Ethereum take ~15 seconds) to make sure it is stable. Then after Verus has confirmed the notarization with a new one, Verus can accept transactions (CCE) from Ethereum, along with the <a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/data-structures-and-encoding/patricia-merkle-trie/\">Ethereum Merkle Patricia Trie</a> proof that relates to the new confirmed data.</p><h3>A Giant Leap¬†Forward</h3><p>The delayed sending of transactions is an important security mechanism that is not present in any other cross-chain bridge. To recap: before any real transactions happen, the Verus network sends proofs to the Ethereum network and vice versa. These proofs are checked and agreed upon by everyone in the network. Only then the actual moving of assets happens. Because of this delayed system, no single entity ever gets control over the assets.

In some cases, the ICO or pre-mined share of ownership was further entrenched by switching from proof of work, as a way for anyone to earn, to pure proof of stake, where owning the network currency is required to earn and those with the most earn the most. As part of prioritizing early growth to capture maximum crypto market share, these platforms generally abdicated the hard work of designing or implementing core protocol primitives, such as currencies or identities, beyond one native currency, as originally conceived in¬†Bitcoin.</p><p>Instead, the popular VM model of many blockchains today, which generally provide a shared ‚Äúcomputer‚Äù or VM on top of a decentralized blockchain, leaves building critical primitives as someone else‚Äôs problem, usually companies and app designers, basically writing centralized apps. Instead of a secure set of underlying rules for currencies, we get best practices and the evolutionary legacy of thousands of ‚ÄúdApps‚Äù, which ironically, are mostly just partial or full re-implementations of the secure primitives missing in the consensus-based L1 protocols themselves.</p><p>As a result of the focus on pumping and market capture vs. evolving what we could learn from Bitcoin with sustainable, decentralized, more secure primitives and better protocol design, billions of dollars of value has been lost or transferred from naive early users who bought into the pumped crypto hype to hackers, scammers, VCs, centralized exits, and MEV-exploiters who all leveraged the mass of weaknesses they either failed to protect against or in some cases created and obscured themselves on systems that don‚Äôt define or enforce even the most common core primitives, currencies or identities. A great deal of loss has been due to obviously poor cross-chain ‚Äúbridge‚Äù design, with the most common problem being bugs in complex smart contract workflow, followed by stolen or compromised private keys of contract owners / controllers, and in some cases, outright theft by contract controllers.</p><p>The lack of agreement on basic primitives and how to represent them in a globally resolvable way has held back general, robust solutions to the fundamental problem of interoperability between blockchains and other financial networks today. To complicate our collective challenges, adding full primitive support in the protocols is hard work, especially in an industry where just a year of development is considered a massive investment that must be rewarded by timely exit liquidity. Consequently, an abundance of shortcuts and heavily marketed yet hastily built solutions still dominate the popular narrative, as hacks, rugpulls, and losses continue to pile¬†up.</p><h3>The solution</h3><p>Verus was founded by technology veterans and others who believe humanity can do better than being exploited by the technology these same veterans had been building for corporations over decades. The Verus PBaaS protocol was designed, built, and tested over more than 5 years by a self-selected and often volunteer group of technology, finance, legal, operations, or just life veterans and newbies alike. Early Verusians shared a common vision and made it reality, achieving a fairly launched, community driven project without VCs or ICO participants who may want to exit and a truly decentralized unlimited scale network that all humanity can use and build upon without paying rent to¬†anyone.</p><p>It has taken exactly as long as it has to realize the vision laid out 5 years ago, which is more clearly relevant today than ever. Along the way, that vision has grown and evolved as new community members contributed their own vision to help us improve, making the Verus PBaaS protocol, of which VIP is a small part, a major milestone for the crypto industry and a move back to the original intent of decentralized networks that was pioneered, if not fully realized by Satoshi Nakamoto in Bitcoin. Verus has taken Nakamoto consensus to the next level with consensus driven functional protocols for network primitives that are needed in any network hoping to securely enable financial applications.</p><p>To ensure maximum decentralization, the Verus Internet Protocol (VIP) takes a maximally decentralized, validator driven approach to its multi-network bridging by incorporating and accounting for currencies, identities, namespaces, and the concept of connected networks themselves in the L0 and L1 consensus protocols. The Verus Internet Protocol provides just enough structure to interoperate with any system that can control funds based on logic and exposes a provable representation of currencies and/or identities.</p><p>By grounding interoperability in a cryptographically provable, hierarchical namespace of self-sovereign, worldwide resolvable identities, VIP enables the first high-throughput, unlimited scale, decentralized, multi-protocol, non-custodial, auditable and transparent, currency and identity aware cross-blockchain communications protocol.</p><h4>A cross-chain protocol with same chain properties</h4><p>VIP can be seen as a cross-chain protocol that operates on proof of proof of consensus (PoPoC). VIP has the following properties:</p><ol><li>Transactions that include cross-chain operations, cross-system currency transfers, or new currency and identity definitions, are standardized in the protocol, as are the semantics of their cross-chain use, fee models, cross-system, name-centric provable routing, and MEV-resistant bundling and rollup properties. These characteristics can be and have been implemented on UTXO, VM-based, and transparently centralized networks.</li><li>VIP supports direct or indirect system&lt;-&gt;system communication, including cross-system export and import of currency and identity definitions, as well as revocation, recovery, and controlling keys. All cross-chain or DeFi functions in the protocol are accessible to full or lite node clients and applications by simply creating standard transaction inputs and outputs that specify the operations. Available APIs on every node or FOSS API server simplify the creation of transactions with cross-chain outputs in response to command requests or JSON RPC¬†calls.</li><li>Transactions with Identity, DeFi, or cross-chain operations, including all inputs and outputs, even exports and imports of all currencies, are checked for validity by miners and stakers with network consensus, just as single currency inputs and outputs are in today‚Äôs single currency blockchain networks.</li><li>Cross-chain protocols operate in the same way as on-chain DeFi protocols and are processed on chain by miners and stakers with a bundle-&gt;export-&gt;import workflow, enabling high-throughput DeFi and cross-chain operations.</li><li>In PBaaS, exports, imports, and DeFi operations are all solved simultaneously and processed with at per-block or larger granularity in an MEV-resistant manner as part of the core protocol, recognizing and enabling the need for beneficial arbitrage, while eliminating toxic MEV such as front-running and sandwiching once and for¬†all.</li><li>All cross-chain operations are proven based on one of the following proof models, which are configurable on a per system/chain basis:</li></ol><ul><li>Decentralized consensus-achieved, witness enhanced, cross-chain cryptographic proofs. (auto-notarization)</li><li>Decentralized consensus-achieved, witness-dependent, cross-chain cryptographic proofs. (notary dependent notarization)</li><li>Semi-centralized or centrally controlled gateway¬†proofs</li></ul><p>Full auto-notarization is only available between Verus and PBaaS chains, and operates faster with but is not dependent on notary witnesses. When auto-notarization is applied to other gateway connections, the protocol will fall back to the closest it can come between auto-notarization and notary dependent, which may evolve towards less dependence on the notaries in future versions. Whether you auto-notarize or depend on notary witness confirmation, all forms of notarization operate similarly. We‚Äôll start with the basic workflow, then highlight differences:</p><ol><li>‚ÄúEarned‚Äù and ‚ÄúAccepted‚Äù notarizations‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäVIP broadly defines two types of cross-system notarizations, earned and accepted.</li></ol><ul><li>Generally, one side of a connection will create ‚Äúearned‚Äù notarizations, which on PBaaS chains or for the Ethereum bridge, are created by miners and stakers adding a notarization output to the coinbase. Earned notarizations, which can only be created by Verus or PBaaS chain miners and stakers, include a way to agree or disagree with specific past notarizations, and are subject to further ‚Äúconfirmation‚Äù rules, which may vary depending on if the rules are ‚Äúauto‚Äù, centralized, or ‚Äúnotary confirm‚Äù.</li><li>Once a new, earned notarization is confirmed, the proof of confirmation is sent to the ‚Äúnotary‚Äù system, which is typically a launch chain, and in the case of the ETH bridge, is Ethereum, along with any notary signatures necessary to prove confirmation, which are typically present. The new, confirmed, earned notarization is entered on the notary chain as an ‚Äúaccepted‚Äù notarization, and is entered as ‚Äúagreeing‚Äù with a prior accepted notarization along with proof of the agreement. If the prior accepted notarization it agrees with is not yet confirmed, then it may be considered newly confirmed.</li></ul><p>2. Once an earned notarization has been agreed to by a new earned notarization, alternating between PoW and PoS blocks to help further decentralized requirements for agreement, and by following all notarization rules, notary witnesses may sign signifying they agree with the notarization as well. Although they can disagree with a signature, no signature is also a valid way to disagree.</p><p>3. After validators and notary witnesses have agreed, or in the case of auto-notarization, a longer validation period with more agreement has passed, the prior notarization agreed with by a new notarization that has passed all necessary agreement, is confirmed. Once that happens, the blockchain is considered final up to the point of that confirmation and will resist reorganizations to any point¬†behind.</p><p>The primary difference between notary confirm notarization and auto-notarization is the amount and type of evidence required to enter a potentially confirmed notarization. Most notably, ‚Äúnotary confirm‚Äù always requires a quorum of signatures from the specified notaries, whereas auto-notarization requires more multi-stage evidence in the face of randomized proof selection, potential fraud proofs and disagreements. Fully centralized gateways still operate on cryptographic proofs, but they only need notaries to agree on the cryptographic roots in order to consider them true and do not need cryptographic proof to establish the notarization proof¬†root.</p><p>Once a proof root has been established by notarization, this root is used to cryptographically prove bundles of transactions exported from one chain or system and imported to another. Even Ethereum transactions are proven in both directions using the same workflow, although Ethereum transactions are validated using <a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/data-structures-and-encoding/patricia-merkle-trie/\">PATRICIA Trie</a> proofs, while PBaaS chains use the Verus <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/merkle-root-cryptocurrency.asp\">Merkle Mountain Range (MMR)</a> method, both being cryptographically sound. Cross-chain bundles of transactions follow the same bundling protocol when sourced from Verus or PBaaS chains as is followed in DeFi to prevent¬†MEV.</p><p>Transactions are always delivered to the destination network with bundles in the order they were created on the source network and according to the enforceable rules of the source network. Since a relayer may add arbitrage transactions when the destination is a PBaaS chain, but may not affect the provable source contents of a relayed bundle from one network to another, no restriction is placed on who relays a valid bundle of transactions. Since validators who relay and mine or stake transaction bundles into a block may earn a validation fee from the import transaction itself, validators or notaries will generally shuttle transaction bundles between chains and networks out of self interest, while having no ability whatsoever to censor or modify protocol level¬†bundles.</p><h4>What witness / notaries do NOT¬†do</h4><p>Witnesses / notaries have no control over what transactions are or are not included or the order in which they arrive from one system to another, as all of that is dictated by the protocol. By default, notaries cannot create notarizations and can only witness the validity of notarizations already created and agreed to by both proof of work and proof of stake validators.</p><p>Witness notaries‚Äô primary role is to agree or disagree with the network validators‚Äô earned notarizations, which are earned on one blockchain and accepted on another chain or system. As long as validators enter valid notarizations as part of the merge mining or staking process, confirm other notarizations entered by past validators, and a majority of notaries sign and witness their recognition of those events, a proof root that can be used by anyone to prove committed bundles of cross-chain transactions is established on both systems for the other. As the protocol ensures via cryptographic proof validation that the cross-chain bundles are the exact bundles in the order they were packaged on the source system, importing cross-chain transaction bundles is a permissionless operation that anyone, usually a validator, can perform, which relies on the proof established in relation to a confirmed, notarized proof¬†root.</p><h4>Do auto-notarization and notary-confirm notarization options have different security considerations?</h4><p>Yes. Proper planning and selection of options and witness ID structure during the launch of a blockchain network or gateway can ensure that security levels meet network demands. There are security tradeoffs between auto-notarization and notary-confirm options, which basically are a tradeoff between a permissionless model where proof root determination is enhanced, but not dependent upon multisig agreement of notary witnesses, auto-notarization vs. a model where establishing any cross-network cryptographic proof root requires the honest participation of a majority of the notary witnesses, which can be represented by revocable and recoverable IDs, allowing for further decentralization, even while requiring participation of a¬†quorum.</p><p>Determining which option to choose, how many and what notaries to choose, what other safeguards can further enhance security, and then understanding the resulting security profile from each set of choices, is important when launching a blockchain or gateway. The following outlines the current high-level security considerations when configuring a new chain or¬†gateway.</p><p>Currently, Verus VIP supports 2 proof models for interchain communication, the Verus PBaaS Merkle Mountain Range proofs, which also assume the Verus Proof of Power protocol, and Ethereum PATRICIA Trie proofs that enable interfacing with VIP between any PBaaS chain, and any Ethereum VM + PATRICIA Trie compatible network.</p><p>Since Verus PBaaS is the only interface to fully support notarization finalization using full auto-notarization, it is important to understand the differences between PBaaS and Ethereum proof protocols. At present, there is no objective proof protocol implementation for Ethereum that is known and implemented, which can operate without dependence on some set of notary witnesses. At this time, auto-notarization, when applied to Ethereum, is more similar to notary-confirm, with additional revocation safeguards that could address more edge-case threat¬†models.</p><p>As new proof algorithms evolve for Ethereum, enabling trustworthy cross-chain proof models in both directions that are both timely and do not need to be backed by witness signatures, it will be possible to update the protocols to remove dependence on witnesses over time. To ensure maximum decentralization on the Ethereum bridge, the network itself can permissionlessly propose contract upgrades, and if affirmatively voted on by Verus validators, an upgrade and new contracts can eventually change the cross-chain proof conditions.</p><p>Auto-notarization of one PBaaS chain on another (PBAAS_AN) differs from and Ethereum interface or notary-confirm (NC) in that, if there are enough validated blocks, both mined and staked, as well as validator agreed notarizations, PBAAS_AN allows validators to finalize a notarization and submit it to the alternate chain. If there are disagreements about the correct notarization, the process becomes an on-chain proof competition, requiring each party to represent a growing, actual chain with both proof of work and proof of stake with an eventual winner. NC still has the miners and stakers create and earn from earned notarizations, but it also must have agreement from specified notaries to finalize any notarization and cannot finalize cross-chain proof roots without that agreement.</p><h4>Improvement over common cross-chain protocols</h4><p>Since Verus VIP does not ever have any identity, multisig or otherwise, hold custody over any funds when crossing from one decentralized network to another, even in the context of the Verus Ethereum contracts, threats caused by malicious notaries or stolen keys to drain funds on decentralized bridges or currencies are simply not viable against the Verus VIP protocol.</p><p>Cross-chain notarizations must first be entered by an earning validator, either PoW or PoS, and must also be agreed to by another validator, alternating between work and stake in eligibility. Only after that happens can notary witnesses apply their signature and agree to make that a confirmed notarization candidate. Still, what happens if a majority of notaries are malicious and colluding, or if some entity was able to somehow steal a majority of the notary private¬†keys?</p><p>If the majority of notary witnesses are honest and operate their witnessing nodes according to the protocol, the security of such a model should be sufficient for any level of cross-chain transaction proof. If, however, a majority of the notaries were colluding and malicious or if their keys were stolen, Verus VIP still provides ways to ensure that the protocol responds to such a situation without risk of loss. Although there are ways to mitigate such a form of attack, even if no mitigation were available, such malicious or fraudulent notary witnesses would need the following in order to attack a PBaaS cross-chain connection:</p><ol><li>Colluding, malicious notaries</li><li>Fake validators with more combined hash + stake power than the publicly validated chain making earned notarizations</li><li>Developers helping them by creating an alternate protocol for the shadow¬†chain</li></ol><p>While you may recognize these requirements as very close to the requirements of attacking any blockchain, the Verus VIP protocol provides a way to even defend against such an unlikely scenario. VIP provides for revocation of all VerusIDs, including notary IDs, even those that are used for Ethereum protocol bridges. Furthermore, each PBaaS chain, including Verus, has a network agreed multisig chain oracle that can separately pause cross-chain notarizations or transactions temporarily, which also can be overridden by network validators.</p><p>To enable yet another layer of safeguards, the Verus VIP protocol does not confirm any notarization that has first been agreed to by validators, then agreed to and signed by all notaries on either the earned or the accepted chain, until a second such notarization confirms the first. This ensures that every notarization on any chain is first made public, given a period of time before confirmation, and finally, if nothing stops it, confirmed.</p><p>Meanwhile, with basic monitoring by witnesses to see if their own identities have signed for anything they do not actually agree with, meaning their keys were stolen, notaries can auto-revoke their own identities and prevent stolen key attacks from being anything more than an inconvenience. Additional monitoring by chain oracle controllers to look for clear discrepancies between soon to be confirmed notarizations and chains that they monitor can also use the oracle notification network to pause cross-chain transactions, providing yet another line of defense for each chain on the¬†network.</p><p>While there are numerous capabilities and safeguards built into the Verus VIP protocol beyond those described in this document, by separating the proof root notarization process and using cryptographic proof as the foundation of a provable, high throughput, cross-chain export/import protocol, <strong>VIP enables the most secure, scalable, decentralized and multi-modal cross-chain protocol ever designed for blockchains and the Internet of¬†Value.</strong></p><h3>Try the Verus Protocol Yourself! ‚úÖ</h3><p>Look up <a href=\"http://docs.verus.io\"><strong>docs.verus.io</strong></a> to use many API commands (e.g. <a href=\"https://docs.verus.io/currencies/launch-currency.html\"><strong>launching currencies, tokens &amp; liquidity pools</strong></a>).</p><p>Or look up the <a href=\"https://wiki.verus.io/#!faq-cli/clifaq-02_verus_commands.md\"><strong>complete command list¬†here</strong></a>.</p><h4>Join the community.
